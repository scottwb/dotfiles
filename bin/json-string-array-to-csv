# Usage:

#   FROM FILE:
#
#     cat filename | json-string-array-to-csv
#
#   FROM CLIPBOARD (macOS):
#
#     pbpaste | json-string-array-to-csv
#
#   FROM CLIPBOARD TO CLIPBOARD:

#
# Common use case:
# ----------------
#
#   CosmosDB UI to Excel/CSV:
#
#     * Query for something in Cosmos DB via Storage Explorer and get
#       an array of strings you want. For example, I have a list of IDs
#       and want to get names, so I query like:
#
#         SELECT VALUES(c.name) FROM c WHERE c.id IN ('id1', 'id2', 'id3')
#
#     * That returns an array like:
#
#         [
#           "Jason",
#            "Brian",
#            "Joe"
#         ]
#
#     * Copy that whole result. Then run:
#
#         pbpaste | ./json-string-array-to-csv | pbcopy
#
#     * Then click a column/cell in Excel and paste.
#
#     * Now all your query result names are in the Excel file in a column.

grep -v "\[" | grep -v "\]" | sed "s/^[[:space:]]*\"//" | sed "s/,$//" | sed 's/"//'
